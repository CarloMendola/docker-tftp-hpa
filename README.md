# docker-tftp

The runtime image is quite small since it is based on Alpine Linux.

The goal is to provide a compromise between a single, monolithic tftpd image that contains all the things and a flexible tftpd image that contains just enough to combine with custom-built data containers or volumes an organization needs to bootstrap their infrastructure.
